PLACEHOLDER ICONS

The following icon files are needed for the extension to work properly:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, the extension will use Chrome's default icon until proper icons are created.

To create proper icons:
1. Design a gold/amber colored icon with ChatGPT green accents
2. Use a chat bubble or AI enhancement symbol
3. Export in PNG format with transparency
4. Replace these placeholder references in manifest.json if needed

The extension will still function without custom icons.
